        <p class="text1">Well, after I got demolished by all the CSS positions, float, this and that, I got very 
            demoralized and I thaught "well this is it, i'm just bad" until I discovered, the amazing, the intuitive 
            flex and grid, I haven't got around to use Bootstrap just yet, but I am looking forward to it because
            every Web Developer I know is in love with it, and if it makes CSS easier, I might take a does,
            I heard once you go Bootstrap you never go back, so we'll see
        </p>
        <p class="text2">This is the map of the beautiful game Dota 2, a game for sweaty 20+ year olds who are sad and hate their life.
            In this game you will see incredible racism from it's toxic community. I am proud to say that I grew up on that map and after
            all the insults that have been directed to me I can say nothing can brake me.
        </p>
        <p class="text3">This, well this needs no introduction, it is perfection. Again from the same compay that made the other sweaty game,
            here you are gonna meet the same type of persons as in the game above but who like to abuse the microphone to scream all the 
            racist slurs they know and no usefull information. I love this game aswell.
